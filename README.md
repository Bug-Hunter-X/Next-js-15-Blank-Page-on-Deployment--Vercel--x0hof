# Next.js 15 Blank Page Deployment Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js 15 where an application works perfectly locally but renders a blank page after deployment to a platform like Vercel. The issue seems to stem from unexpected behavior with the new App Router, and the solution is outlined below.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev` to see the application working locally.
4. Deploy to Vercel (or similar platform). Observe the blank page.

## Solution

The solution often involves carefully reviewing the application's structure and potentially applying one of the following:

* **Verify correct routing:** Ensure the app router is configured properly (check `app` directory structure) and handles all expected routes.
* **Check for runtime errors:** Look for issues in your server components (API routes, etc.) that might prevent rendering.
* **Review deployment logs:** Vercel logs can reveal hidden issues not apparent in the browser console.
* **Simplify application:** Begin with a minimal version to isolate and diagnose the problem systematically.

This example demonstrates a potential solution related to file structure and routing, but other factors can also contribute to this kind of blank page error.
